# Tintracker

This is a series of tutorial that teaches you the basics to build mobile applications following modern development standards.

In this first tutorial you build an app called **Tintracker** for tracking the time on your activities 
and for calculate your earnings. üóÇÔ∏èüí∞

You build a complete Android application using the full potential of the **Kotlin** programming language and 
you will learn how to use **Clean Architecture** on your projects to build robust, flexible and maintainable applications.

## Course overview

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - A modern programming language that makes developers happier.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/coroutines-guide.html) - A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.
- [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-flow/) - A cold asynchronous data stream that sequentially emits values and completes normally or with an exception.
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - A collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps. 
    - LiveData
    - ViewModel
    - ViewBinding
    - Room - The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
- [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/) - A pragmatic lightweight dependency injection framework for Kotlin developers.
- DiffUtil - DiffUtil is a utility class that calculates the difference between two lists and outputs a list of update operations that converts the first list into the second one.
- Material Components - Modular and customizable Material Design UI components for Android.
- Dark mode support
- Animation
- more...
